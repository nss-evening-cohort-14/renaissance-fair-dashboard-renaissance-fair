PO: **Dr. T**

## Description
Welcome to FreeLancer the worlds go to organizer of Renaissance Fairs. Now that your company has proven its worth at staffing all sorts of different Renaissance events the owners have decided to come out of the dark ages and build one of those **FANCY** things on the interwebs.

Your task is to create a dashboard for the owners to keep track of the Food, Souvenirs, Shows, and Staff they have available across all locations.  They should be able to perform full CRUD on each of those 4 topics.  Additionally they should be able to authenticate into the application - if they are not authenticated the website should perform READ only operations.

The owners of FreeLancer are expecting to see some great branding but they aren't sure what they want so make it flashy and make it remind them about why they fell in love with Renaissance Fairs in the first place.
